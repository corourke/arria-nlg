<h4><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">Performance highlights</span></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Global Growth Fund</strong> Class A shares at net asset value (NAV) <strong>increased</strong> during the
  quarter <strong>but</strong> <strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">underperformed</span></strong> the
  benchmark.</p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">Contributors to performance</span></strong></h4>
<p>
<p>- <strong>Stronger stock selection and an</strong> <strong></strong> <strong>underweight</strong> (2.34%) position in
  Consumer Staples, a relatively weak performer in the benchmark, added to relative returns. The fund&rsquo;s
  <strong><strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> stocks showed particular strength. An overweight (3.82%) in the
  positive performing Financials sector added to relative returns as well.</p>
<p>- Geographically, stronger stock selection in Korea, Netherlands, Germany and Spain added to relative return.
  Additionally, an overweight position in the positive performing Korean market also added to relative return.</p>
<p>- <strong><strong>Swedish-</strong></strong>based <strong><strong><strong><strong>Multi-Sector
          Holdings&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></strong>company <strong>INVESTOR AB INVEB</strong> was the leading
  individual contributor for the quarter.</p>
</p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">Detractors from performance</span></strong></h4>
<p>
<p>- <strong>Weaker stock selection <strong>and an</strong></strong> overweight (14.59%) in the positive performing
  Information Technology sector added to relative returns. Within Information Technology, holdings in the Diversified
  Banks , Multi-Sector Holdings and Life & Health Insurance stocks showed particular weakness. An underweight (3.45%)
  position in Communication Services, a relatively weak performer in the benchmark, added to relative returns as well.
  In the Communication Services sector, the <strong><strong>Interactive Media &amp; Services and Cable &amp;
      Satellite</strong></strong></strong> stocks showed particular strength.</p>
<p>- Geographically, weaker stock selection in Japan, Australia and Kenya detracted from relative return. Additionally,
  an underweight position in S.Africa , the benchmark&#39;s top performing market over the quarter, along with an
  overweight position in the relatively weak Kenyan market also negatively impacted relative returns.</p>
<p>- <strong><strong>Swedish-</strong></strong>based <strong><strong><strong><strong>Multi-Sector
          Holdings&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></strong>company <strong>INVESTOR AB INVEB</strong> was one of the
  largest individual detractors for the quarter.</p>
